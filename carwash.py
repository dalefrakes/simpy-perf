Carwash example.

Covers:

- Waiting for other processes
- Resources: Resource

Scenario:
  A carwash has a limited number of washing machines and defines
  a washing processes that takes some (random) time.

  Car processes arrive at the carwash at a random time. If one washing
  machine is available, they start the washing process and wait for it
  to finish. If not, they wait until they an use one.
